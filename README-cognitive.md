# CogniMap - Advanced Cognitive Assessment System

A revolutionary web application that moves beyond traditional learning styles to reveal your unique cognitive fingerprint across five unconventional dimensions.

## üß† What Makes This Different

Instead of outdated "visual/auditory/kinesthetic" categorizations, CogniMap explores how your mind naturally processes information through:

### Five Cognitive Dimensions

1. **üåä Texture** - How information 'feels' to you
   - Smooth & Flowing: Connected, narrative information
   - Rough & Grippable: Concrete, tangible concepts
   - Sand & Shifting: Flexible, adaptable content
   - Clay & Moldable: Interactive, manipulable ideas

2. **üå°Ô∏è Temperature** - Your learning energy preferences
   - Cool & Logical: Analytical, data-driven approaches
   - Warm & Narrative: Story-based, emotional connections
   - Hot & Urgent: High-intensity, immediate application
   - Alternating: Variable pacing and emotional intensity

3. **üå≥ Ecosystem** - How you organize concepts
   - Garden & Organic: Natural, evolving connections
   - City & Systems: Structured, systematic relationships
   - Forest & Hierarchical: Layered, foundational building
   - Ocean & Depth: Deep, far-reaching connections

4. **‚è∞ Temporal** - Your natural learning rhythms
   - Tidal & Steady: Consistent, regular patterns
   - Seasonal & Deep: Cyclical preparation and intensity
   - Lightning & Burst: Sudden insights and breakthroughs
   - Heartbeat & Maintenance: Balanced rhythm with acceleration

5. **üèóÔ∏è Spatial** - How you construct knowledge
   - Foundation Up: Building systematically from basics
   - Big Picture Down: Starting with overviews, adding details
   - Modular: Independent pieces connected later
   - Flowing: Organic, natural knowledge emergence
